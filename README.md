# Baseball-Player-Position-Predictor
An Neural network model that predicts the best suited fielding position based on your career data 

Sports is one of the biggest entertainments and business in the world. 
There are billions of money being invested and spent by both the management and fans to build and watch their teams perform. 
Use of data analytics becomes a vital part to deliver a positive result. 
In this era, Sports teams are said to be having competitive disadvantage if they donâ€™t use data to make decisions. 
Baseball is one of the biggest sport in North America and it is more popular in United States. 
Our goal is to find a way in which we can position our fielders in baseball such that, we reduce the runs that is being conceded by the team to the opponents. 
We experimented this solution using Artificial Neural Networks.
